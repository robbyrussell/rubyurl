Boxcar Conductor
==============

This plugin provides you with deployment tools for your Rails application,
which will help you deploy to your RailsBoxcar.com instance.


## Requirements ##

You'll want to make sure that you have the following gems installed
before you begin:

palmtree capistrano

With newer versions of capistrano you should install the following:

fastthread

If you plan on using mongrel + nginx instead of Phusion Passenger, you
should also install the following gems:

mongrel mongrel_cluster


## Automatic Installation ##

If you're running a recent version of Rails, you can just install the
plugin directly by doing:

script/plugin install git://github.com/planetargon/boxcar-conductor.git


## Manual Installation ##

Otherwise, you can just do a manual install by following these steps:

0.9) If you have git installed on your machine, run the following from
     your application root directory:
    
git submodule add git://github.com/planetargon/boxcar-conductor.git vendor/plugins/boxcar-conductor

    And then skip to step 3. Otherwise...

1) Download a tarball of the latest release from

http://github.com/planetargon/boxcar-conductor/tarball/master

2) Untar this into your vendor/plugins directory, and rename the resulting
   folder to boxcar-conductor

3) cd into the boxcar-conductor directory, and do:

../../../script/runner install.rb
